/**
 * lib/scan-completeness.js — produce warnings telling the user when fad-checker
 * has gone as far as it can without running the real build tool.
 *
 * The two big "you need a real scan" cases:
 *   1. BOMs (Maven `<scope>import</scope>`): version pins live in another
 *      POM that may itself be transitive. We follow LOCAL BOMs in core.js,
 *      but external BOMs (Spring Boot, Quarkus, JBoss…) bring in a managed
 *      version table that we can't enumerate without resolving them. The
 *      resolved deps map will still list deps with unresolved `${prop}` or
 *      missing versions in this case.
 *   2. Unresolved versions: any dep whose `version` is null or still
 *      contains a `${…}` placeholder — we can't query OSV/Maven Central
 *      for these, so they silently fall out of the scan.
 *
 * For npm/yarn, lockfiles already pin everything, so we only flag the
 * already-handled "no lockfile" case from lib/npm/collect.js elsewhere.
 *
 * Output: an array of warning objects matching the same shape as
 * lib/npm/collect.js warnings ({ type, manifestPath?, message, ... }).
