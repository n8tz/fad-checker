/**
 * lib/parallel-walk.js — bounded-concurrency recursive directory walk.
 *
 * A serial readdirSync walk is fine on a fast local disk, but on a high-latency
 * filesystem (WSL/9p, network mounts, the air-gapped VM in the field) each readdir
 * pays a round-trip, so a big tree takes tens of seconds per walk — and fad-checker
 * walks the tree several times (detection, pom discovery, jar discovery, JS manifest
 * discovery). Issuing many readdirs concurrently turns that latency-bound serial walk
 * into something close to a single round-trip deep, which is dramatically faster.
 *
 * `onDir(absDir, entries)` is called once per visited directory with its Dirent[].
 * `skipDir(absChildDir, name)` prunes a child directory (caller's own skip policy);
 * it receives the child's absolute path (for path-relative globs) plus its basename.
